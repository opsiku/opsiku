## A Little About Me

So, I'm Seuriin, a college student totally hooked on Python, AI, Web Development, and Reverse Engineering. I'm a curious builder always down to tinker, learn, and create something dope.  

- 🎓 Still surviving the **BSIT** grind at **Colegio de Montalban (CDM)**.
- 💻 Constantly sharpening my Python automation, scraping, backends, you name it.
- 🧠 Hardcore into AI and future tech.
- 🧩 Cooking up custom VMs. Crying in opcodes rn 😢
- 📚 Break time? That’s manga, manhwa, or light novels all the way.
